    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 3/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for sprinkling</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons instant espresso coffee powder, divided, plus more for sprinkling</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups horchata, divided</li>
        <li>2/3 cup canned sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 (8-ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
</ul>
   <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (or 175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium for 30 seconds. Gradually beat in sugar 1/4 cup at a time. Scrape bowl. Beat until light and fluffy, 2 minutes more.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Add eggs one at a time, beating after each. Beat in 4 teaspoons espresso powder, the vanilla, and almond extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Alternately add flour mixture and 1 3/4 cups horchata, beating on low after each addition until just combined. Batter may appear curdled, it will be fine. Spread batter into prepared pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Whisk together remaining 3/4 cup horchata, the sweetened condensed milk, and remaining 2 teaspoons espresso powder.</p>

    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Poke holes all over cake with a skewer or chopstick. Gradually pour horchata mixture evenly over the cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 9</h3>
    <p>Completely cool cake on wire rack.</p>

    <h3>Step 10</h3>
    <p>Top cake with whipped topping. Cover and chill at least 1 hour.</p>
